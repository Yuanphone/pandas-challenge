## Background
   In this Pandas Challenge, our role is Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Two datasets were used to analyze the district-wide standardized test results:schools_complete.csv and student_complete.csv. After access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, our task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance by using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.
  The first step is to merge the two datasets and to calculate the district summary, including the total number of schools, students and budget, the average math and reading score, the percentage of students with a passing math score and reading score and overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math and reading). The second step is to create and overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including: school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing.
Based on the previous dataframes, we did further analysis and found the observable trends:
### 1. The top 5 performing schools vs.the bottoms 5 performing schools
   The top 5 performing schools are charter schools and the bottoms 5 performing schools are district schools. The total students in top 5 performing schools are less than students in bottom 5 performing schools. The total budget and per student budget in top 5 performing schools is less than in bottom 5 performing schools. The average math and reading score and the percentage 0f passing reading , math and both are obviously higher than the bottom 5 performing schools   
### 2. Math scores and reading scores by Grade at each school have no obvious difference.
   In each school, the average math and reading score are calculated for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th). From the results, there are slight changes in scores by grade but no obvious trend can be observed.
### 3. The per students budget is negative correlated with the school performing.
   The spending budget for each student is higher, and the school performing ( including student's average math score, the average reading score, percent of passing math, percent of passing reading, and the overall passing decreases) is lower. And the per student budget is lower, and the school performing is higher. Therefore, the per student budget and school performing are negative correlated. This irregular finding of this analysis gives an open space for researchers to work on this more.
### 4. The school size is larger and the reading and math performances are worse.
    The schools that have the number of students are less than 1000 (small) and the number of students between 1000 and 2000 (medium) have the similar school performing in reading and math. But when the number ofstudents is greater than 2000 and less than 5000 (large), the school performing in math and reading significantly decreased.  This finding needs to be invesgated more. The smaller size schools may have lower student-teacher ratio, and the stuents can be educated better.
### 5. The Charter schools have higher school performances than the district schools in math and reading
    Compared with district schools, the charter shools have higher average math and reading scores and percentage of passing math, reading and overrall passing.
This finding needs to be considered incoperated with previous findings. For example: the charter schools have smaller school size and less school budget. 
    These findings can motivate the researchers and the school board to further investigating the reasons and factors among the relationship of school type, school size, school budget and school performing. These findings also can provide evidence for them to make stratagies to elevate the students performing, like downsizing school.
